## Getting Started

To get started with the Crypto Arbitrage bot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tor69zz/Crypto-Arbitrage.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages.
   ```bash
   cd Crypto-Arbitrage
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Tor69zz/Crypto-Arbitrage/releases) to download the latest version of the bot. Follow the instructions provided there to execute the bot.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the bot, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python bot.py
```

Make sure you have configured your settings before running the bot. The bot will start monitoring the exchanges and executing trades based on the configured strategies.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in the `config` directory. Here, you can set your API keys, trading pairs, and other parameters.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "exchange": "Binance",
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "api_secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET",
  "trading_pairs": ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"],
  "profit_threshold": 0.5
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_API_SECRET` with your actual API credentials from the exchange.

## How It Works

The bot continuously monitors price differences across selected exchanges. When it detects a profitable arbitrage opportunity, it executes trades automatically. Hereâ€™s a simplified flow of how the bot operates:

1. **Data Collection**: The bot fetches real-time price data from the configured exchanges.
2. **Analysis**: It analyzes the data to identify arbitrage opportunities.
3. **Execution**: When a profitable opportunity arises, the bot places buy and sell orders accordingly.
4. **Monitoring**: The bot keeps track of all trades and updates the user on performance.

## Trading Strategies

The bot supports various trading strategies to maximize your profits:

- **Simple Arbitrage**: Buy low on one exchange and sell high on another.
- **Triangular Arbitrage**: Exploit price differences within the same exchange across different trading pairs.
- **Market Making**: Provide liquidity by placing buy and sell orders simultaneously.

Feel free to modify or add new strategies to suit your trading preferences.
